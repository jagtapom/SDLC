Each framework—Streamlit, Plotly Dash, and NiceGUI—brings unique strengths to the table, particularly when applied to complex SDLC pipelines that require Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interaction, modularity, and real-time feedback.

Streamlit excels in rapid prototyping and simplicity. Its Pythonic syntax and widget integration make it ideal for data scientists and ML practitioners needing quick feedback loops. However, for multi-user HITL or more interactive workflows, it may require workarounds.

Plotly Dash stands out for enterprise-grade data visualization and structured app development. It offers advanced callbacks and layout management, making it a solid choice for complex analytical dashboards. Its steep learning curve and verbosity may limit rapid iterations in early-stage SDLC workflows.

NiceGUI is emerging as a modern, full-stack UI framework with seamless FastAPI integration. It supports real-time interactivity, session-aware state, and native HITL design using UI events—making it particularly well-suited for automated agents and approval-based pipelines in SDLC.
