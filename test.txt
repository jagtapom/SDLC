Subject: Progress Update: Migration from Streamlit to NiceGUI for HDLC Automation Dashboard

Dear [Leadership Team / Respected Leaders],

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide a quick update on the UI modernization efforts for the HDLC Automation Dashboard. As part of our exploration, Iâ€™ve been working on transitioning the existing Streamlit-based application to NiceGUI, a more flexible and scalable alternative for building production-grade web interfaces.

So far, I have successfully:

Replicated the Streamlit functionality in NiceGUI with a cleaner and more responsive UI.

Integrated the BA Agent from our AutoGen backend to generate user stories based on uploaded requirements.

Implemented Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval, dynamically showing UI elements based on agent output.

Designed the interface to efficiently manage state and improve user interaction with minimal frontend code.

Key Observations: NiceGUI vs Streamlit
Feature	Streamlit	NiceGUI
UI Flexibility	Limited, suitable for quick dashboards	Highly customizable, production-ready layouts
State Management	Session-based, limited interactivity	React-style reactivity, more dynamic
Component Control	Simple but rigid component control	Fine-grained control, supports real-time UI
Scalability	Suitable for POCs	Better suited for scalable enterprise apps
Human-in-the-Loop UX	Achievable, but harder to extend	Seamless and dynamic interactions

The next milestone is to finalize the integration of the JIRA agent post-HITL approval, completing the automation workflow.

I look forward to sharing the complete demo soon. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like an early walkthrough.
